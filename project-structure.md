# Project Structure: EnvironmentTest

- `android/` - Contains all the native Android code and project files.
- `ios/` - Contains all the native iOS code and project files. (I can't test this on Windows)
- `node_modules/` - Contains all the JavaScript dependencies downloaded by npm.
- `App.js` - The main component that is the starting point of our app.
- `package.json` - Lists all the project's dependencies and scripts (like `start`, `run-android`).
